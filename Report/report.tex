\section{Introduction}

Recent state of the art natural language models represent words by embedding them
as vectors in a continuous vector space \cite{mikolov2013efficient} \cite{pennington2014glove}.
These embeddings are learned as weights of a recurrent neural network language model.
It has been demonstrated that the distributed representation of words as vectors
in a common vector-space captures not just syntactic similarities (e.g. $cat$
is close to $cats$) but semantic similarities as well. Concretely, the model's ability to
perform word-arithmetic has been demonstrated \cite{mikolov2013linguistic}.
To exemplify this, let $f$ be the word-embedding function. Ideally, we would then
have an embedding where distances in vector-space give a measure of
semantic-similarity between the words. For two word pairs such as $(king, man)$
and $(queen, woman)$ which have the same relation (or similarity) we would
obtain $f(king)-f(man) = f(queen) - f(woman)$ or equivalently $f(king)-f(man) +
f(woman) = f(queen)$.


The goal of this work is to further evaluate the performance of the popular word2vec
tool on these tasks. word2vec is an implementation of the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram
models introduced in \cite{mikolov2013efficient}. Both of these models are based
on shallow two-layer neural networks with architectures depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:cbow}
and Figure~\ref{fig:skip}. Both architectures take 1-hot-encoded words as inputs
which get then mapped into into an $N$-dimensional vector via the weight matrix
$W$. The hidden unit then accumulates the sum of these vectors for all the input
words.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
